Rally Planned vs Actual Burndown Chart
======================

![Title](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/PlannedVsActualBurndown/master/screenshots/title-screenshot.png)

## Overview

The Planned vs. Actual Burndown app captures a releaseâ€™s burndown progress. It gives you a chart overview with a table to view the data. 

## How to Use

### Running the App

If you want to start using the app immediately, create an Custom HTML app on your Rally dashboard. Then copy App.html from the deploy folder into the HTML text area. That's it, it should be ready to use. See [this](http://www.rallydev.com/help/use_apps#create) help link if you don't know how to create a dashboard page for Custom HTML apps.

Or you can just click [here](https://raw.github.com/RallyApps/PlannedVsActualBurndown/master/deploy/App.html) to find the file and copy it into the custom HTML app.

### Using the App

Use this app to help you determine if:

* The release is progressing as expected.
* The work is logically divided between the iterations.
* There should be a reallocation of the user stories to other iterations.

## Customize this App

You're free to customize this app to your liking (see the License section for details). If you need to add any new Javascript or CSS files, make sure to update config.json so it will be included the next time you build the app.

    rake debug                      # Build a debug version of the app, useful for local development
